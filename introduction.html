	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>NAND flash based solid state disks (SSDs) have become
one of the dominant storage components in different
computing domains, ranging from embedded systems to
general purpose workstations to high-performance datacenters [6, 13, 22, 57]. High-performance computing
employs SSDs in various ways such as an SSD cache
[41, 55] or a bursty buffer [39], to mitigate the performance bottlenecks imposed by the conventional hard
disk drives (HDDs).</p>
<p>While SSDs can significantly improve the overall system performance, there is also an emerging trend that
pushes SSDs toward an entirely different direction [20,
31, 51]. Specifically, major flash vendors amplify storage capacity by transitioning from 2D NAND flash to
3D NAND flash. The 3D NAND flash technology layers flash cells vertically, which can increase the size of
the individual flash dies. For example, Samsung stacks
100 layers of charge trap flash (CTF) cells, and as a result can achieve 1 Terabit density flash dies without any
modification to the existing flash interface [10].</p>
<p>Layering multiple CTF cells increases the number of
pages in a physical block, rather than the number of
blocks within a die, which makes the internal microarchitecture of 3D NAND different compared to the 2D
planar flash. Consider the vertical architecture of a particular 3D NAND flash [20], VNAND. VNAND increases
the die density by stacking more layers, but in this architecture, CTF cells across the different layers share a same
set of pillars (channel), thereby increasing the number of
pages per block. Furthermore, as all the block-related
control circuits of VNAND reside on the block decoder
of the top layer due to staircase-like control gate [20],
this decoder area controls the signals to all CTF cells of
the underlying layers. Consequently, as one stacks more
layers, the amount of such block-related control circuits
for each block increases. However, the area from where
one can control all layers is limited, which in turn reduces the number of blocks but increases the number of
pages per block. Owing to this, a block of VNAND contains at least 3 times more pages per block compared to
the 2D flash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new structure of VNAND can exacerbate the overheads incurred due to garbage collection (GC), which is one of the well-known performance
bottlenecks in modern SSDs. Specifically, the peripheral
circuits and the micro-architecture of VNAND’s [19, 26]
large-granularity erase makes the latency characteristics
of 3D NAND worse compared to 2D flash. In addition,
the large number of pages per block can potentially accommodate more valid data that a flash firmware needs
to migrate for each GC. The longer erase time and relatively more valid pages to migrate (i.e., a series of reads
and writes) can have a significant performance impact
on GC operations and may in turn render 3D flash difficult to directly replace 2D flash in many designs of high performance SSD.</p>
<p>In this work, we propose PEN, a novel strategy to enable Partial Erase for 3D NAND flash technology. PEN alleviates the GC overheads by introducing a finer erase
unit in 3D NAND, which can reduce number of valid
pages copied during a GC, thereby reducing the GC latency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that investigates partial-erase for 3D NAND, starting from the circuit level and evaluating its architectural
ramifications from both the performance and reliability
angles. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
<br>• We present a comprehensive architectural support,
“partial-erase operation” that addresses the potential performance degradation imposed by 3D NAND flash. The
proposed low-level operation can selectively reset multiple pages instead of erasing a bulk block by modifying
the 3D NAND peripheral circuits, page decoders, and
command logics, with minimum area overhead.
<br>• While our partial-erase operation can be leveraged to
alleviate performance degradation, the number of pages
per reset should be determined at the design time. However, it is a non-trivial task to statically decide the operation granularity of such partial-erase operation. This
inflexibility in turn can lead to a large mapping table size
or introduce more valid page migrations. We propose
a novel GC algorithm, called “M-Merge” that keeps the
original mapping table size when the partial-erase operation is employed. In addition, M-Merge can adaptively
decide the optimal partial-erase granularity by considering program-disturbance issues at a run-time.
<br>• We demonstrate that the performance degradation in
3D NAND flash stems from the increased number of
valid pages copied during a GC operation. The evaluation studies using a set of 12 real storage workloads reveal that our PEN mechanism (putting partial-erase operation and M-Merge together) can significantly reduce
the valid page copies during a GC operation, thereby improving the overall system performance.</p>

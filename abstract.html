	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>3D NAND flash memories promise unprecedented flash
storage capacities, which can be extremely important in
certain application domains where both storage capacity and performance are first-class target metrics. However a block of 3D NAND flash contains many more
pages than its 2D counterpart. This increased number of
pages-per-block has numerous ramifications such as the
longer erase latency, higher garbage collection costs, and
increased write amplification factors, which can collectively prevent the 3D NAND flash products from becoming the mainstream in high-performance storage domain.
In this paper, we introduce PEN, an architecture-level
mechanism that enables partial-erase of flash blocks. Using our proposed partial-erase support, we also discuss
how one can build a custom garbage collector for two
types of flash translation layers (FTLs), namely, blocklevel FTL and hybrid FTL. Our experimental evaluations
of PEN with a set of diverse real storage workloads indicate that the proposed approach can shorten the write
latency by 44.3% and 47.9% for block-level FTL and hybrid FTL, respectively.</p>
